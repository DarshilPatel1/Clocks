## Overview

Here are types of clocks that I know of and have made them in UI/2D form so you can directly include them without needing to wory about anything.
I have used basic sprites to make them but you can change this for best fit of your project.

## Getting Started

You will need DOTween and TMPro in your project to use this as they are one of the best helpfull packages/plugins.
Thats all you need, Head down to demo scene to check out the clocks or directly import the main Clocks prefabs from prefab folder.
You can also use digit prefabs to use them as timer, counter or let the horses of your imagination run wild!

## Features

UI based/2D
Dynamic
Moduler
